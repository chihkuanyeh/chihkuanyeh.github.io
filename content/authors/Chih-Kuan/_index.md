I am a fifth-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University Machine Learning Department. My research intrests include understanding and interpreting machine learning models, and how to use these understanding to improve models. My main goal is to place explanability methods on an objective footing such as measurable metrics and axiomatic properties (while I also believe human interaction is crucial). I'm also interested in low-resource learning, algorithmic game theory and statistical machine learning. I am in the job market this year. I started playing chess as a hobby since late 2020, and I'm 1900 rapid on lichess currently.
